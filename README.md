# Kaggle
This is the work I've done while going through the ML/DL tutorials at Kaggle.

It starts with the file temp.py. Continues with fitting.py. Last one in the series is randomforest.py. Next comes the deep learning folder.
History.py has some commands for git integration for self reference when using spyder.
